Y Chip Area Visualizer: Visualize [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) [`stat`](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/stable/cmd/stat.html) reports.

Originally designed for [my **Y**SYX project](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/ics2023), it can be generalized to any compatible [**Y**osys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) outputs. Currently this app accepts:

* `synth_stat.txt` ([example](/assets/synth_stat.txt))
* JSON ([example](/assets/input.json))

They can be generated by Yosys commands:

```tcl
tee -o synth_stat.txt stat -liberty $LIB_FILE
tee -o input.json stat -liberty $LIB_FILE -json
```

## Build

```sh
yarn install --immutable
yarn build
```
